# Smart To-Do List Manager (Python Project)

## 📌 Objective

A simple **Command-Line To-Do List Manager** built using **pure Python** (without Pandas or external libraries).  
It allows users to manage their daily tasks with the following features:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks (color-coded priority)
- Filter tasks (Pending, Completed, Due Today/Tomorrow, Overdue)
- Search tasks by title or description
- Automatic overdue detection
- Data stored in `tasks.json` file (auto-created if missing)

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

✔️ **Add Task** — Auto-incremented ID, Pending by default  
✔️ **Mark as Completed** — Adds completion timestamp  
✔️ **Delete Task** — Remove by ID  
✔️ **View All Tasks** — Sorted by Overdue/High/Medium/Low, with color-coded Priority  
✔️ **Filter Tasks** — Pending / Completed / Due Today / Due Tomorrow / Overdue  
✔️ **Search Tasks** — By title or description (case-insensitive)  
✔️ **Automatic Overdue Detection** — Checks dates and marks overdue tasks  
✔️ **File I/O** — Persistent storage using JSON (`tasks.json`)
